        <h2>Health Tips</h2>
        <p>Stay healthy with these tips:</p>
        <ul>
            <div class="image1">
            <li>Eat a balanced diet</li>
            <p>A balanced diet gives your body the nutrients it needs to function correctly.<br>
               A balanced diet supplies the nutrients your body needs to work effectively. <br>
               Without balanced nutrition, your body is more prone to disease, infection,<br>
               fatigue, and low performance. Children who don’t get enough healthy foods<br>
               may face growth and developmental problems, poor academic performance, and<br>
                frequent infections.
                
                They can also develop unhealthy eating habits that may persist into adulthood. </p>

            <div class="image2">
                <li>Exercise regularly</li>
                <p>Exercise is physical activity that enhances or maintains fitness and overall health.<br>
                   It is performed for various reasons, including weight loss or maintenance, to aid growth<br>
                   and improve strength, develop muscles and the cardiovascular system, hone athletic skills,<br>
                   improve health, or simply for enjoyment.</p>

            <div class="image3">
                <li>Get enough sleep</li>
                <p>Sleep is important for maintaining optimal health and well-being. Like exercise<br>
                   and a balanced diet, getting enough sleep may help prevent a range of health issues,<br>
                   including heart disease and depression.</p>

            <div class="image4">
                <li>Stay hydrated</li>
                <p>Staying hydrated is one of the best things you can do for your overall health. Staying hydrated<br>
                   can help support physical performance, prevent headaches and constipation, and more. The human<br>
                   body comprises around 60% water. It’s commonly recommended that you drink eight 8-ounce (237-mL)<br>
                   glasses of water per day (the 8×8 rule). Although there’s little science behind this specific rule,<br>
                   staying hydrated is important. Here are 7 evidence-based health benefits of drinking plenty of water.</p>
