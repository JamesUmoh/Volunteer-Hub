            <p>Your team undoubtedly has a lot of unique skills that other people
                in your community could benefit from. Whether your expertise lies
                in sales, marketing, technology, customer service, or somewhere 
                else entirely – why not offer a free class to anyone who might
                be interested? This can be a great opportunity for your team to
                share their knowledge, practice their public speaking, and help
                others develop key business skills.

                Once you’ve decided on a topic, you may want to check with your local 
                library, community center, or elder care home to see if they would be 
                interested in promoting and hosting your seminar.</p>

            <h2>Help the Homeless in Your Community</h2>

            <p>This is something that a lot of people turn a blind eye to but is also an important cause that your team can have a direct impact on by volunteering.

                Partner with a local food bank or homeless shelter to see how you can help the homeless in your neighborhood. Whether you assist with their fundraising efforts, prepare food and drinks for their mealtimes, or bring in donations via another type of charitable initiative, every little bit you do can go a long way.</p>
